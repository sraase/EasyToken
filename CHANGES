v0.92-sra - 2022/10/03

- Note: This is a non-official fork with limited testing.

- Update native dependencies (libxml2: 2.9.12, gmp: 6.2.1,
  nettle: 3.8.1, stoken: 0.92) and mirror addresses.

- Migrate build system to Android Studio / gradle as the
  old system is no longer working. Use newer NDK to build
  native components as well.

- Set minSdk 21 (Android 5.0) and targetSdk 24 (Android 7.0)
  to avoid a compatibility warning on newer devices. Also fixes
  a black bar shown on some devices.

- Remove crash reporting to the original project.

- Replace the file selector with Android DocumentProvider
  functionality and remove the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.

- Fix token import from the file manager.

- Update references and links to point to the new repository.


v0.91 - 2014/12/20

 - Use more specific MIME type matches so that Easy Token associations don't
   show up in Contacts.

 - Update libstoken to v0.81 and switch from tomcrypt to nettle.  Most of
   the changes in v0.8/v0.81 won't matter on Android, but it is now possible
   to import hard token seed files if desired.

v0.90 - 2014/07/26

 - Rework handling of bound device IDs during token import.  Try to guess
   it based on the current (unique) device ID and all known class GUIDs.
   Allow the user to override it, in case of a collision.

 - Limit import string to 64kB to avoid OutOfMemoryError crashes on invalid
   tokens.

v0.81 - 2014/07/06

 - Fix bug in lock screen widget where it would "bounce" between the tokencode
   display and the clock display for no apparent reason

 - Show the "confirm import" screen unconditionally, so there is a clear
   indication that email import succeeded

v0.80 - 2014/07/05

 - Initial public release
